## Hi there! üëã

I'm **Jin**, a Computer Science student at **UW-Madison** with a passion for building efficient, scalable systems, infrastructure automation, and full-stack development. I love to dive deep into both the **backend architecture** and the **automation frameworks** that power modern applications. I‚Äôm always exploring new technologies and improving my technical toolkit to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Expertise

### **Automation & DevOps**  
- **Containerization**: I've extensively used **Docker** to containerize applications and ensure consistent environments from development to production.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Proficient with **Ansible** to automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration management.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Experience setting up end-to-end pipelines using **GitHub Actions**, integrating automated tests and deployments for seamless updates.

### **Backend Development**
- **API Design**: I focus on creating well-documented, RESTful APIs with tools like **Express.js** and **Node.js**, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
- **Database Management**: With hands-on experience in **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, and **Supabase**, I focus on building efficient, optimized data architectures.
- **Microservices**: I have experience with distributed systems using lightweight, scalable services that communicate asynchronously, typically through messaging systems like **Redis Streams**.

### **Cloud Infrastructure**  
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) & Microsoft Azure**: Skilled in deploying cloud-native applications and managing services like virtual machines, cloud storage, and networking for robust cloud infrastructure.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Deployed **Next.js** applications on **Vercel** using serverless functions to build fast and efficient web solutions.

### **Testing & Quality Assurance**  
- **Test Automation**: Created automated test pipelines using **JUnit** for Java applications and **Cypress/Jest** for frontend testing. This significantly reduces manual QA overhead and catches bugs early in development.
- **Performance Testing**: I ensure optimal performance with load testing, especially for web services, and have integrated performance benchmarks within CI pipelines.

## üîß Favorite Tools & Technologies
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, GitLab ‚Äì version control is second nature, and I actively use branching strategies to manage project workflows.
- **Scripting**: I enjoy automating repetitive tasks using **Python** and **Bash** scripts. These have helped in setting up development environments and automating deployment processes.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Proficient with monitoring tools like **Prometheus** and logging frameworks such as **Elasticsearch** and **Grafana**, ensuring the applications I build are always observable and reliable.

## üìö What I‚Äôm Learning
- **Kubernetes**: Currently exploring **Kubernetes** to improve my understanding of orchestrating containerized applications at scale.
